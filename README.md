The primary objective of this project was to develop a smart recommendation system that suggests personalized product recommendations to users based on their implicit feedback. 
By analyzing usersâ€™ interactions with products (such as clicks, purchases, and views), the system provides tailored suggestions to enhance user experience and increase engagement.

Key Features:

Collaborative Filtering Approach: Utilized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method in PySpark to implement collaborative filtering, focusing on implicit feedback to 
identify patterns in user behavior.
Implicit Feedback: Instead of relying on explicit user ratings, the model captured implicit signals like purchase history, clicks, and browsing behavior to predict 
user preferences more accurately.
Scalability: Built to handle large datasets, ensuring the model is efficient even with vast amounts of user interaction data.
Improved Personalization: By leveraging matrix factorization, the model identifies latent factors, providing highly personalized product recommendations.
